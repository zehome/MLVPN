# Filtering system
# when MLVPN is configured to balance traffic across multiple links
# It may be required to force some traffic (VoIP) through a specific
# interface. No reordering or load balancing will be applied on thoses
# packets.

# The variables inside the block will define the interface your filter
# will be routed to.
# Filters are EXCLUSIVE FIRST MATCH. That means if a packet matches
# an expression and the interface is ready to receive data,
# filtering STOPS and the packet is sent.
# Filters are pcap-filter(7). Like tcpdump. (man 7 pcap-filter)
