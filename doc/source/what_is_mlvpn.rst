What is mlvpn
=============

mlvpn is a piece of software, similar to OpenVPN_, which can create a network
tunnel between two computers.

mlvpn encapsulates network packets, using UDP and sends them encrypted over the
internet to another location.

The primary use of mlvpn is to create bonded/aggregated_ network links in order to
benefit from the bandwidth of multiple links.

Still, mlvpn can be used as a regular secure tunnel daemon, capable of handling failover
scenarios.

.. _aggregated: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation

Features
========
  * Bandwidth aggregation of multiple internet connections
  * Automatic failover, without changing IP addresses or interrupting TCP connections in case of a failure
  * Encrypt and authenticate connections using libsodium_.
  * Hot configuration reload (by signaling SIGHUP)
  * Scriptable monitoring
  * Remote monitoring through UNIX socket or TCP/HTTP socket. (JSON API)

Limitations
===========

Non equivalent links (3G/4G and *DSL or WIFI and *DSL)
======================================================

Note: make sure you set the bandwidth_upload on each link, otherwise each link
will only receive as much traffic as the slowest link can handle.

mlvpn can aggregate very different links if reordering is enabled.

If you have a high latency 3G/4G link and a DSL connection, then
adjust reorder_buffer_size to a reasonable value to get good performance.

Note that the created aggregated link will have the WORST latency of all the links. ie: the 3G/4G link.

Re-ordering is important because packets are not sent at the same speed
on every path. Packets would come of order which confuses a LOT TCP.
Without re-ordering enabled, expect to have the bandwidth of the slowest link.
