.SH "NAME"
\fBmlvpn\fR \- MultiLink Virtual Public Network aggregator
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBmlvpn\fR \-\-user mlvpn \-\-config /path/to/mlvpn\.conf
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBmlvpn\fR is designed to help building aggregation tunnels between two hosts\.
.
.P
Main features are:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Bandwidth aggregation
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
High availability (detects link up/down)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Security (Privilege separation, auth and cipher using libsodium)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Scritable
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
External program control (using unix socket or TCP/HTTP socket)
.

.
.P
\fBmlvpn\fR uses privilege seperation to increase security\. The monitor process is running as root, doing only privileged operations, the other process is doing most of the stuff\.
.
.P
In order to be able to aggregate multiple links with mismatched bandwidth, \fBmlvpn\fR uses a weight round\-robin algorithm\. \fBmlvpn\fR then sends packets, according to the capacity of the link\. It should be noted that \fBmlvpn\fR only knows about what it sends, so you should ONLY use \fBmlvpn\fR on the links if you want good balancing of the links\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.

do not use setproctitle(3)
.
.TP
\fB\-\-name\fR, \fB\-n\fR \fIname\fR
change process title to \fIname\fR (privileged process will be named \fIname\fR [priv]: this option is disabled with \fB\-\-natural\-title\fR is used
.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
log to stderr instead of syslog
.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR, \fB\-v\fR
increases verbosity (repeat multiple times to increase more)
.
.TP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR, \fB\-q\fR
decrease verbosity The verbosity will print usefull messages and errors only\. If \fB\-\-quiet\fR is specified, then only errors will be shown / logged\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-yes\-run\-as\-root\fR
don\'t drop privileges, kills privilege separation, do not use unless you are hacking \fBmlvpn\fR
.

.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
